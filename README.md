# kaltura-capture-protocol-sample-app
This is a guide on how to implement a custom protocol for launching Kaltura Capture from your own application. *It is not a standalone app*

## Getting started ## 

Don't forget to fill in the blanks in `config.php`. Your Partner ID, Admin Secret (can both be found in Integration Settings in the KMC), and the relevant User ID, as well as the current version of Kaltura Capture and any name to describe the user role for KalturaCapture. 

## Download links for the latest version of Kaltura Capture ##

Before launch is available, the application must be installed. The download URLS for both Windows and OSX can be found in the global Kaltura UiConf object. Right at the beginning of the php script, after configuring and setting a new Kaltura Session on a Client object, you'll find this line `list($windows, $osx) = getDownloadLinks($client);` 

*getDownloadLinks()* looks for a uiConf object with the name "KalturaCaptureVersioning" and then decodes the returned json. Both download links, which are found in the config object of the uiConf, are returned from the function. 

You'll find those links being used in the html at the bottom of the code. You can also do a check to see if the user already has the application installed (read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2872090/how-to-check-if-a-custom-protocol-supported)). 

## Creating a launch url ## 

Essentially the launch url looks like this: 

```kaltura-pc:<Base 64 encoding of a json object containing external settings>```

The json object containing external settings looks like this:
```
    {
        "appToken": "xxxxxx",
        "appTokenId": "1_xxxxx",
        "userId": "xxxx.xxxxxx@kaltura.com",
        "partnerId": "xxxxxx",
        "serviceUrl": "http://www.kaltura.com",
        "appHost": "xxxxxxx.kaltura.com",
        "entryURL": "media",
        "hostingAppType": "MediaSpace",
        "hashType": "SHA256"
    }
```

As you can see, you'll need a special App Token, for which you'll need a Kaltura Session that has admin privileges (meaning, `Session Type = ADMIN`). Let's walk through the parts of the code: 

**getAppToken()** gets available app tokens for a specific user id, and then sends them through a filter (below) to get the relevant kalturaCapture token. If there are none, a new token is created via `addToken()` 

**filterToken()** iterates through tokens for this user and returns the first one of type "kalturaCaptureAppToken" and correct version 

**addToken()** creates and returns a new app token with specific privileges retrieved in `getRole` below and other settings such as hashType, token type, and version. 

**getRole()** searches for an existing role by the role name described in the config. If the role doesn't exist, a new one is created in `addRole()`. The role ID is returned. 

**addRole()** creates and returns (the id of) a new role with the name described in the config, various permissions needed for launch, and a tag of "kalturacapture"


When you finally have the app token, you're ready to create the json settings object. Most fields are self explanatory. 
- **appHost** is the hosting application url that is being used when generating the uploaded entry URL. For example, when using KMS, the host url will be `www.<partnerId>.kaltura.com`
- **entryURL** is the relative path to the media entry in our Media hosting application. For example, when using KMS, when set to 'media' the entry url generated by the application will navigate to the media entry itself, like `www.<partnerId>.mediaspace.com/media/<entryId>`
- **hostingAppType** is currently being used to determine the hosting site url for displaying it in our application info page. If 'kaf' type was chosen, the app will concat 'appHost' and 'entryUrl' properties to assemble the site url; otherwise the app will use only the 'appHost' property.

Encode the object with a Base64 encoder, and you should end up with a string that looks something like this:

`ICAgIHsNCiAgICAgICAgImFwcFRva2VuIjogInh4eHh4eCIsDQogICAgICAgICJhcHBUb2tlbklkIjogIjFfeHh4eHgiLA0KICAgICAgICAidXNlcklkIjogInh4eHgueHh4eHh4QGthbHR1cmEuY29tIiwNCiAgICAgICAgInBhcnRuZXJJZCI6ICJ4eHh4eHgiLA0KICAgICAgICAic2VydmljZVVybCI6ICJodHRwOi8vd3d3LmthbHR1cmEuY29tIiwNCiAgICAgICAgImFwcEhvc3QiOiAieHh4eHh4eC5rYWx0dXJhLmNvbSIsDQogICAgICAgICJlbnRyeVVSTCI6ICJtZWRpYSIsDQogICAgICAgICJob3N0aW5nQXBwVHlwZSI6ICJNZWRpYVNwYWNlIiwNCiAgICAgICAgImhhc2hUeXBlIjogIlNIQTI1NiINCiAgICB9`

Be sure to add the prefix `kaltura-pc:`, as can be seen in the HTML portion of the code. Run that url from your browser, and, assuming you've got Kaltura Capture installed, the app should now launch!
